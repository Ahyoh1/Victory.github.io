											<p> Victory and I crossed paths in 2021 when he came on board as the lead facilitator of the 
												data analysis track of our DigiGirls program. <br> Victory’s exceptionalism was evident from the
												very beginning. He was responsible for creating the curriculum for the data analysis track 
												which was approved to be used for training by the UK government. He also delivered live 
												and recorded classes to the cohort which had over 1000 beneficiaries. 
												<br>Victory was able to explain technical concepts and software like Structured Query Language (SQL) for querying 
												databases and Microsoft excel for data analysis to the beneficiaries using simple and clear 
												examples and methods. The cohort recorded a huge success with about 25% of
												beneficiaries landing jobs in the data analysis space within 3 months of graduation.<p> 
												
												There were a lot of positive reviews from the beneficiaries and the UK government and Victory was 
												invited to facilitate the data analysis track for the second cohort. <br>
												In the early stages of the second cohort, Victory’s constant drive for improvement was
												obvious. He immediately made strategic adjustments to the curriculum adding modules for
												data visualisation to better help the beneficiaries meet the present demands of the data
												analysis world. <br> 
												This improved curriculum was approved and adopted to teach about 5000
												beneficiaries in the data analysis path. Over a hundred of those beneficiaries have gone on
												to join leading banking, Fintech and other technological firms across Africa. <p>

												Victory has been pivotal to us here at Cybersafe and I'm sure he will be an asset to any organisation in the world.

											<p>Victory first joined the Utiva team as a student in the data accelerator program during the 2020
												pandemic. On my first call with Victory, it was evident that he had a passion for the technological
												industry. I was sure that with a little guidance, he would transform the data science scene.<p />
												Well, my intuitions were right! Just three months after beginning training, Victory joined Darlytics
												as a data analysis intern where he started using his newly learned skills to query and transform
												data. After this, he joined one of Nigeria's leading fintech companies, Carbon as a business
												intelligence analyst. At Carbon, he was in a team of four people on three different continents. This
												role really amplified not only his technical skills and prowess but also his teamwork and
												interpersonal relationship in a remote working world.<p /> 
												Victory’s success in very little time caught the attention of the Utiva team and he was invited to
												facilitate the data accelerator cohort at Utiva. He effectively managed a cohort of over 500
												beneficiaries and his students left very good remarks about his ability to communicate new and
												complex concepts to them. Over half of his students have gone on to make giant strides in the
												data analysis sector.<br />
												<br />
												Victory’s story is nothing less than an exceptional talent with a very bright and promising future. I
												am immensely proud of how far he has come. His tenacity and drive for knowledge over the years
												have been outstanding. It is because of these that I can boldly say Victory is definetely a great advantage 
												to any company he works with in the future. <p>

												<h3><a href= "https://www.linkedin.com/in/tamsinharriman/"> Tamsin Harriman</a></h3>

											<p>In July, 2022, the analytics team at Blue Motor Finance began searching for a data
												scientist who could come on board to build a machine learning model for the collections
												team. Victory’s profile stood out because of his previous experience in analysing loan
												data and creating algorithms with the technologies similar to the ones used at Blue.<p />
												Victory showed a good understanding of the steps needed to build an efficient data
												science model. He was diligent and patient to understand how the business works and
												what the task at hand was before he began to query the database using Blue Motor’s
												Microsoft Sequel server. He was able to gain quick understanding of the database and
												showed great prowess in his Structured Query Language (SQL) skill by creating,
												transforming and modifying fields when necessary. His SQL codes were reviewed and he
												was praised for clarity and consistency when creating the output data needed.<p /> 
												Victory then moved on to input the data into the python environment where he built the
												model with advanced python libraries and functions. The model had an accuracy of over
												90% and thus, the collections team have since been able to predict if a customer will fail
												on an expected payment a week before the expected payment date.<br />
												<br />
												This model was very important to us at Blue and Victory knew just what to do to get it up and running.
												I am positive that Victory's work ethic will be a great addition to any team he joins in the future. <p>
